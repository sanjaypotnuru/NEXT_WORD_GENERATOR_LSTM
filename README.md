# NEXT_WORD_GENERATOR_LSTM

Next Word Prediction means predicting the most likely word or phrase that will come next in a sentence or text. It is like having an inbuilt feature on an application that suggests the next word as you type or speak. The Next Word Prediction Models are used in applications like messaging apps, search engines, virtual assistants, and autocorrect features on smartphones.

🔍 A Little Bit of Sherlock Holmes 🔍

As an AI enthusiast, I've been tinkering with language models and text generation lately. Inspired by the timeless adventures of Sherlock Holmes, I decided to create a Next Word Prediction Model using LSTM neural networks.

📚 Dataset: Sherlock Holmes Stories
🧠 Model: LSTM-based Next-Word Prediction

🔮 Generated Text:
"I will leave if they have encountered any mysterious clues."

It's fascinating to see how the model predicts the next word based on the context. 🤖📝
